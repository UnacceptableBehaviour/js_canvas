This very loosely based on how diffusion works.  
Say we have 2 pixels/cells filled with gas of different densities, and on one side the gas is much more dense than the other:  
  
Given that the particles are moving randomly (why is irrelevant for purpose of animation!) it stands to reason that
if there are more particles on one side moving randomly then its more likely that a higher quantity of particles will
cross the line from this side. This work in every direction since the movement is random.

More in depth explanation (possibly made more complicated than necessary!) [The diffusion equation | Week 12 | MIT 18.S191 Fall 2020 | Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3V0BJLIo_c)
Highly recommend [3Brown 1Blue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) GREAT content!    
  
So if we paint a dot on the canvas representing say 40000 particles in that space, the next step would be to
distribute them equally in every direction in the next frame. 10K up, left, right & down. Then next step 2.5k from
each pixel to its surrounding pixels etc etc. Not forgetting that particles cross in both directions!
see below. (Note the jagged edge on the left, there shoul be one on the right to but it was cropped.)

Diffusion from a single point - Code @ [u7_fp_diffusion.js](https://github.com/UnacceptableBehaviour/js_canvas/blob/bd248eeecf5ca825f3d2555b439fa13862c85c50/test_pages/u7_fp_diffusion/u7_fp_diffusion.js)  
  
A square matrix creates an aliasing effect and you do no get any curves :/  
To get around this a hexagonal matrix is used with each point connecting to six points around it.
This is done by shifting every other row over by hlf a cell.  
  
Each cell/point is allocated a FabricCell object which is walled in by 6 neighbours.  
  
Each of which is referenced in the this.walls[] array. Following is theTLHC of the above image
broken down into FabricCell objects represented by squares.  
  
![fabricCell connectome](https://github.com/UnacceptableBehaviour/js_canvas/blob/master/test_pages/u7_fp_diffusion/imgs/fabric_array_connections.jpeg)  
  
### Understanding the FabricCell connectome diagram above:  
Each cell is painted with 4 pixels (2x2).  
TLHC is the X,Y fabric array position (canvas position is calculated from this & the offset).  
TRHC is the offset: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset by 1/2 CELLWIDTH  
  
#### The positions around the hexagon are represented by letters, the number is the array position:  
In the diagram above:  
If its a dot it means no neighbour. NULL pointer.  
If its a number its the number in the this.walls[] array where a reference to that neighbour is stored.  
```
class FabricCell {
    this.walls = [];    // access neighbour - this.walls[TR].inMsgs
    this.msgs  = [];    // diffuse out from here
    this.inMsgs  = [];  // accumulate incoming here

// enum Walls                                   //   Cell Wall Reference
class Walls {                                   //   
  static ME = 0;  // this cell                  //         TL    TR   
  static L  = 1;  // left                       //          2    3
  static TL = 2;  // top left                   
  static TR = 3;  // top right                  //       L    ME    R
  static R  = 4;  // right                      //       1    0     4
  static BR = 5;  // bottom right                 
  static BL = 6;  // bottom left                //          6    5
  static MAX_FABRIC_WALLS = 7; // array size    //         BL    BR
};
```
  
In the animation cycle the whole fabric is painted and then particles are diffused into neighbours (and accumulated)
ready for next cycle.
