# End of Course Project 4 - Maths Tiles
### Aim
Try and reproduce something like this page [here](https://soulwire.co.uk/math-for-motion/) from Justin Windle
A creative developer whos work I was introduced to doing this course.

  
### 1. Create a MathsTile class
Create a frame border for the tile - prototyping.
Centre a dot - a circular representation of the pulse of the equation.
Pass an equation callback.
Equation runs a 360deg/2pi cycle
Draw line
  - frequency or wavelength will govern the plot across the tile
  - and the radius of the pulsing shape - circle in the prior art

  
### 2. How to add unit tests maybe?

**Some experiments:**
