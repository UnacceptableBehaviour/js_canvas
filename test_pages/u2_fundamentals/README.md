Running canvas-sketch:  
```
> canvas-sketch sktch-01.js --new                 # normal mode
> canvas-sketch sktch-01.js --output=output/01    # output mode - create image in dir output/01
```
Settings can be used to create A4 size canvas & ppi setting for printing. Handy!
  
This generates a lot of node packages - debatable whethter or not to include them in repo.
But they do create a lot of noise when doing a diff
# ignore file following this name in path
Add following line to .gitignore file.  
```
node_modules/
# put comments like this on separate line since they apear to nause things up on the same line :(
```
Add note on specifying file to ignore for git diff.
